Data collection and visualization project using APIs, web scraping, and the Stack Overflow survey dataset.

This project explores data collection, analysis, and visualization. It covers retrieving and paginating job postings with the GitHub REST API, collecting job data from the GitHub Jobs API, and applying web scraping techniques to extract links, images, and HTML table data into CSV files. It also includes data visualization using the Stack Overflow survey dataset, employing histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bubble plots, pie charts, stacked charts, line charts, and bar charts to extract meaningful insights.
